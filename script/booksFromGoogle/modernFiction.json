          "Two women, bound by a shocking event, drawn to a vast and beautiful country they cannot forget. Kate Carrington has cut all ties with Africa, the land of her birth. Her past is buried alongside her missionary parents, the last reminders locked safely away in the attic. But when a mysterious woman moves in next door, Kate's carefully constructed world is torn apart. Annah Mason has led an extraordinary life – one that has taken her from a hospital in Langali to the company of rainmakers deep in the Tanzanian bush. Her connection with the Waganga people has brought her the great love of her life, and freedom beyond her dreams. Yet she carries with her a painful secret. Now, the time has come for her to tell her story – to finally set Kate free. The international bestseller that has captured hearts the world over. 'This most moving book, whose every breath is a love-song for Africa and her people, is a faultlessly woven cloth.' LE MONDE (FRANCE) 'One to keep you reading late into the night.' WEST AUSTRALIAN 'Beautifully written, lively and sympathetic... an adventurous and highly entertaining read.' BOOKSHOW (GERMANY)",

This tech mogul, known only as 'Principal', takes Josh deep into his own mind, and outlines the history of Tetration, which started by revolutionising the search engine and later ventured into smartphones, computer manufacturing and the surveillance of American citizens. Accompanying Josh on a mind-bending world tour of local Tetration offices, from Palo Alto to Dubai, Principal soon initiates Josh into the secret pretext of the autobiography project, and the life-or-death stakes that surround its publication.",

Blame the fukú—a curse that has haunted Oscar’s family for generations, following them on their epic journey from Santo Domingo to the USA. Encapsulating Dominican-American history, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao opens our eyes to an astonishing vision of the contemporary American experience and explores the endless human capacity to persevere—and risk it all—in the name of love.",
