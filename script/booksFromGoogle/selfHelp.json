          "The New York Times bestseller from the author of Chasing the Scream, offering a radical new way of thinking about depression and anxiety. What really causes depression and anxiety--and how can we really solve them? Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told that his problems were caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate whether this was true--and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. Across the world, Hari found social scientists who were uncovering evidence that depression and anxiety are not caused by a chemical imbalance in our brains. In fact, they are largely caused by key problems with the way we live today. Hari's journey took him from a mind-blowing series of experiments in Baltimore, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin. Once he had uncovered nine real causes of depression and anxiety, they led him to scientists who are discovering seven very different solutions--ones that work. It is an epic journey that will change how we think about one of the biggest crises in our culture today. His TED talk, “Everything You Think You Know About Addiction Is Wrong,” has been viewed more than eight million times and revolutionized the global debate. This book will do the same.",

          "The Better Man Project is a look at my daily journey towards becoming a better man, as well as a glimpse into the valuable lessons I learn along the way. Socrates once said, \"True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.\" I, in fact, know nothing. But because I know nothing, I have given myself the best opportunity to learn from everything. That is why I am here in front of you today, and that is how The Better Man Project was born. Several years ago, I sat on the bed in my small dorm room and realized that whatever path I was on was destined for disaster. My life lacked love, passion, and goals that could inspire me to achieve my true potential. I was desperately trying to contain an emotional tornado inside of me, and realized that the damage was reaching a point of irreversibility. The forces of change were knocking on my door, and if that call was left unanswered, my worst nightmare was waiting for me right around the corner. I decided to try something new. The Better Man Project was originally intended to be a 30-day challenge to develop myself into a better man. Well, the project passed 30 days, 60 days, 90 days...and now I stand in front of you - the product of almost 1,000 days of personal cave diving into the depths of my heart - lantern in hand, searching for even more answers. I am not here to give you a formula. I am not here to tell you that I have some secret for how to be happy. Instead, I am here to tell you why you should embark on a journey that will be marked by times of darkness, but that will in the end, result in one thing: light. Each and every one of you will have a different path. No two will be the same, but they will all have something in common: the fact that you will be going against the grain and living a life that you are proud of. You will face your fears by moving against a culture that is designed to groom you to be just like everyone else. But it won’t be easy because you will have to overcome significant obstacles in order to achieve true happiness and realize your dreams. However, when you finally remove can’t from your vocabulary, you will develop into someone who finds motivation and inspiration within in order to create a vibrant future. I can tell you that my journey will never end. My life has permanently changed course because of this project and I have truly learned how to be a man. And to all the women out there, my project isn’t just about men’s issues. I am confident that if you join me and open this book, you might just find out how to be a better person as well. I promise you that this is going to be one awesome, wild ride. Love. Passion. Never Quit. \"Sanders unlocks the door of each aspect of a man's world as he breaks through the boundaries of life's disappointments, anguish, pain, and hostility. He uncovers the mysteries of love, honesty, integrity and respect. His acute sense of understanding the world around him and his ability to relate to all people enables him to share his philosophies and he gifts his inspiration to us in this book. It is not his full story. It is not the answer. It is the beginning and the now of a great man and his unique insights to how we can all become better every day.\" - Melissa Reyes \"This book is a groundbreaking work that will inspire men and women alike.\" - endsolitary \"I recommend this book highly for anyone that has a dream that they themselves are holding in a mental prison.\" - teddy3indc \"This book is filled with real life events, both good and bad, that have a way of speaking to any audience. It has not only helped me jumpstart a new, more positive way of thinking, but has also allowed me to reflect on certain aspects of my own life that I would not have before reading this.\" - jg3485",

          "Written in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, The Road Less Traveled continues to help us explore the very nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us learn how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one’s own true self. Recognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.",
